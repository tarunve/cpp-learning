/**
 *  Constructor:
 *  ===========
 *  ->  Constructor is a special member function with same name as that of class.
 *  ->  used to initialize the objects of a class.
 * 
 *  Characteristics:
 *  ===============
 *  ->  Should be declared in the public section only.
 *  ->  It is automatically invoked when object is created.
 *  ->  They cannot return vallues and does not have return types.
 *  ->  It can have default arguments.
 *  ->  We cannot refer to their address.
 * 
 *  Copy Constructor:
 *  ================
 *  ->  Which makes copy of object.
 *  ->  When no copy constructor is found, compiler provides its own copy constructor.
 *  
 *  Why copy constructor argument should be const in C++?
 *  ====================================================
 *  ->  When we create our own copy constructor, we pass an object by reference and we generally pass 
 *      it as a const reference.
 *  ->  One reason for passing const reference is, we should use const in C++ wherever possible so 
 *      that objects are not accidentally modified. This is one good reason for passing reference as 
 *      const, but there is more to it. For example, predict the output of following C++ program.
 *  ->  Compilation error if not specified constructor as const : The reason for compiler error is, 
 *      compiler created temporary objects cannot be bound to non-const references and the original 
 *      program tries to do that. It doesnâ€™t make sense to modify compiler created temporary objects 
 *      as they can die any moment.
